It won&#8217;t work for all as some users change IP numbers regularly, but this is another tool you can use. Be careful when using a Blacklist function as you don&#8217;t want to block the innocent, nor do you want to block IP ranges.

    <li>If you feel creative, create your own custom theme for the form by selecting <strong>custom.css</strong> from the menu. You will get a style sheet that contains all of the IDs, classes, and elements you&#8217;ll need, but no properties will be defined. Have fun and feel free to share your creation with us and others. If it&#8217;s really good and flexible, we made add it to the download and give you full credit. Need a head start? Copy the contents of one of the other themes and begin with that.</li>
    <li>After choosing a theme from the menu, simply click the <strong>Select Theme</strong> to apply your selection. Your selected theme will appear in the editor.</li>
    <li>If you want to add theme files, simply upload them to the <code>/wp-gbcf_themes/</code> directory. They will automatically be added to the menu so they can be selected.

<!-- FAQS -->
<div class="wrap" id="form-help">
<h2>Helpful <abbr><span class="abbr" title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</span></abbr>s</h2>
 <p>Below is a list of some common questions you may have followed by their respective answers. They appear in no particular order.</p>
 <dl>
  <dt>I&#8217;m getting a Configuration <span class="reg_alert">Notice!</span> &#8212; Why is that?</dt>
   <dd>In order for the contact form to function, the Form Page <abbr><span class="abbr" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</span></abbr> and at least one email address must be <a href="admin.php?page=Configuration#gen">Configured</a>.</dd>
  <dt>I&#8217;m getting a Malformation <span class="reg_alert">Warning!</span> &#8212; Why is that?</dt>
   <dd>The Form Page <abbr><span class="abbr" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</span></abbr> must contain &#8220;<code>http://</code>&#8221; and a &#8220;<code>.</code>&#8221; (dot) and at least one email address must contain &#8220;<code>@</code>&#8221; (at symbol) and a &#8220;<code>.</code>&#8221; (dot). Common mistakes are to enter a &#8220;<code>,</code>&#8221; (comma) instead of a &#8220;<code>.</code>&#8221; (dot) in either variable, or to apply a &#8220;<code>;</code>&#8221; (semi-colon) instead of a &#8220;<code>:</code>&#8221; (colon) in a URL. Please check your <a href="admin.php?page=Configuration#gen">Configuration</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Good grief, I&#8217;m getting BOTH the <span class="reg_alert">Notice!</span> <em>and</em> <span class="reg_alert">Warning!</span> &#8212; Oh my, why is that?</dt>
   <dd>Relax. the Form Page URL, the Email Address, or both fields are actually empty. You need to do some <a href="admin.php?page=Configuration#gen">Configuration</a> it seems.</dd>
  <dt>I&#8217;m getting a <abbr><span class="abbr" title="PHP Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</span></abbr> <code>mail()</code> function warning <span class="reg_alert">Warning!</span> &#8212; What can I do?</dt>
   <dd>Like the warning states, contact your web hosting provider to see if they will enable the function. Some disable it to prevent abuse of the function. If they won&#8217;t, you&#8217;re out of luck. There is a way to force the function, but we won&#8217;t go against the wishes of your host.</dd>
  <dt>I&#8217;m getting a <span class="reg_alert">Referrer Missing or Mismatch!</span> error when testing the form. Why?</dt>
   <dd>There are two reasons you may get this error: Either you have referrer logging blocked on your browser or you have incorrectly entered the &#8220;Form Page URL&#8221; on the form <a href="admin.php?page=Configuration">Configuration</a> page. The Form Page URL must match what you see on your browser&#8217;s address bar when you&#8217;re on your contact page. 99.99% of the time this is the issue. If the URL does match exactly, try testing with a different browser or ask others to test it as well to see if it is your browser&#8217;s settings.</dd>
  <dt>On some errors my email address is provided. Is this safe?</dt>
   <dd>In a nutshell, yes. The errors that do this are ones real human visitors may encounter and for the sake of accessibility, we don&#8217;t want to leave them without a means of contact. Please note that these particluar errors &#8212; there are three of them &#8212; are placed last in the script so &#8216;bots will trip prior errors first. Also, if a &#8216;bot does trip one of these errors, it is highly unlikely that they will realize the submission wasn&#8217;t successful and will move on without harvesting your email address.</dd>
  <dt>When I submit the form I am returned to my blog index (main) page. What&#8217;s up with that?</dt>
   <dd>This is probably due to <code>php.ini</code> file settings. Please contact your web hosting provider and explain the issue. They should be able and willing to correct this for you. If not&#8230; sorry, there&#8217;s nothing we can do.</dd>
  <dt id="alt1">I&#8217;m trying to configure the form but I don&#8217;t know the <abbr><span class="abbr" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</span></abbr> yet.</dt>
   <dd>You will have to enter that value immediately <em>after</em> creating the page. Then add the code <code>&lt;!--gb_contact_form--&gt;</code> to the content area of your designated WordPress &#8220;Page.&#8221; Also note that is has been reported that entering <code>[gb_contact_form]</code> in WordPress version 2.1 will also work. Optionally, you may also create a page <a href="#templ">template</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Can I send the submitted email to multiple addresses at the same time?</dt>
   <dd>You bet. Just enter as many email address you want, being sure to separate each one with a comma. Additionally, a version of this form is available for those who want multiple recipients. This version is not free-of-charge, though.</dd>
  <dt>What is the Carbon Copy feature exactly?</dt>
   <dd>Selecting &#8220;Yes&#8221; allows form users the option of having a modified copy (not actually a CC) of the email they&#8217;re sending to you to their submitted email address. Choosing &#8220;No&#8221; removes this option.</dd>
  <dt>My time zone and the time zone of my server are the same. What should I put in the <em>Time offset</em> field?</dt>
   <dd>If your time and your server&#8217;s time are one-and-the-same, enter or leave the default <code>0</code> in the field.</dd>
  <dt>What does it mean to Blacklist an <abbr><span class="abbr" title="Internet Protocol">IP</span></abbr>? It sounds bad.</dt>
   <dd>Basically it means blocking or barring users with an IP address matching one of those you may add to the list to prevent them from using the form. It&#8217;s not fool-proof, and should be a last resort measure.</dd>
  <dt>Some IP addresses are supplied with the form Blacklist. Are these evil users?</dt>
   <dd>No, they are just example numbers assigned to the &#8220;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority&#8221; and are reserved. Want to see who owns what? Check out the <a href="http://www.arin.net/whois/" title="External Link">Arin Whois Database</a> for more information.</dd>
  <dt>I broke the form making custom edits. Will you help me fix it?</dt>
   <dd><em>Maybe</em>, if we have time and it is an obvious error. Otherwise this will probable be a billable service.</dd>
  <dt id="alt2">Can additional text content be added after or below the form?</dt>
   <dd>Yes, but only if you edit the <code>wp-gbcf_form.php</code> file. See instructions on line 1330. Also, and this is important, please be sure to parse the text you may enter with an appropriate element such as <code>&lt;p&gt;Your Text&lt;/p&gt;</code>. Another option is to create a WordPress template, like so:
    <ol id="templ">
     <li>Copy the page template and rename it whatever you want, ie. &#8220;contact.php.&#8221;</li>
     <li>At the very top of the file add this:
<pre>
 <code>&lt;?php 
  /* 
   Template Name: Contact
  */
 ?&gt;</code>
</pre></li>
     <li>Within the file where the page content would be, place this:
<pre>
 <code>&lt;?php </code>
  // WILL BE PAGE CONTENT
    <code>$post_data=get_post($post-&gt;ID); echo $post_data-&gt;post_content;</code>

  // FORM SHOWS NEXT
    <code>gbcf_show(); 
 ?&gt;</code>
</pre><small>(Swap the two sections if content is wanted <em>after</em> the form.)</small></li>
     <li>Add the file to the theme directory.</li>
     <li>Create a new WordPress page for the form &#8212; or use the existing page (Edit).</li>
     <li>Remove the &#8220;tag&#8221; if the page already exists, but feel free to add other text content.</li>
     <li>Select &#8220;Contact&#8221; from the pull down on the sidebar of the edit page. (Contact if that&#8217;s the name of the template you made.)</li>
     <li>Save it. That&#8217;s it. Need help? Contact <a href="http://green-beast.com/contact/">Mike Cherim</a> or <a href="http://www.blue-anvil.com/contact/">Mike Jolley</a> for professional assistance.</li>

  <dt>Can I edit the form file, <code>wp-gbcf_form.php</code>, and the scripting?</dt>
   <dd>You can if you want to, but it is not recommended unless you are a <abbr><span class="abbr" title="PHP Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</span></abbr> expert. The script is large and will be difficult to edit or modify. Maybe in the future we will add a function to modify the form further but for now what you see is what you get. We attempted to satisfy the needs of as many users as possible by creating a one-size-fits-all contact form with some really common options and fields.</dd>
  <dt>I forgot to set permissions on a file I edited. Will I lose my work?</dt>
   <dd>You don&#8217;t have to. Set the permissions on the style sheet you&#8217;re editing now, before doing anything else, then refresh the page to re-post the editor form (answer Yes if your browser asks you) and your changes will be saved. Whew, that was close, huh?</dd>
  <dt>How do I set file permissions?</dt>
   <dd>In your server or by way of an <abbr><span class="abbr" title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</span></abbr> program locate the file you want to set and look for its properties (will vary by server or program). These properties can sometimes be found by right-clicking on the file. You want to set permissions or CHMOD to Read and Write for Owner, Group, and Everyone: <code>-rw-rw-rw-</code> or <code>666</code>. Still need help? Contact your host or <abbr><span class="abbr" title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</span></abbr>, the maker of your FTP program, or search for &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=setting+file+permissions&amp;btnG=Google+Search" title="Google Search">Setting File Permissions</a>&#8221; on the web.</dd>
  <dt>I get multiple emails when the form submits. Why is that?</dt>
   <dd>We&#8217;ve seen this happen with one theme and we do not know why but the theme is different than most. Another possibility is that your contact page accepts comments. To fix that disallow comments and pingbacks for your contact page.</dd>
  <dt>How do I style the form so it looks nice?</dt>
   <dd>Check the <a href="admin.php?page=Styling">Styling</a> page to modify your form&#8217;s appearance to suit your needs. Several themes are provided, you can also select none and use your own style sheet, or you can create a custom theme of your own with the editor.</dd> 
  <dt>I want to customize my form but I don&#8217;t know how. Can you help?</dt>
   <dd>Yes, if you want to change the look. First you&#8217;ll want try all the themes to see if one will work for you or get you close. If not working out as well as you like, contact <a href="http://green-beast.com/contact/">Mike Cherim</a> or <a href="http://www.blue-anvil.com/contact/">Mike Jolley</a> to request a styling quotation. We can do! If you want to make code modifications, we <em>may</em> help, depending on what you want to do. Some custom editions have been made &#8212; such as our multi-user version for WordPress &#8212; and may be available for purchase.</dd>
  <dt>My visitors seem to have difficulty answering my Anti-Spam question. What should I do?</dt>
   <dd>Ask an easier question with only one possible answer. Asking things like &#8220;<em>What is the meaning of life?</em>&#8221; or any question that can be answered subjectively simply won&#8217;t do. Even providing the actual answer within the question itself will work. Rule-of-thumb: Keep it Simple!</dd>
  <dt>Is the Anti-Spam question or its answer case-sensitive?</dt>
   <dd>No. Both question and answer are case-insensitive to admin and user. We were proactive in the creation of this form and tried to think of and correct all possibilities that might inhibit legitimate communications.</dd>
  <dt>I don&#8217;t get any more spam and now I&#8217;m lonely. What should I do?</dt>
   <dd>Sorry to hear that. Disable this plugin and put your email address on your pages. You&#8217;ll be popular again soon.</dd>
